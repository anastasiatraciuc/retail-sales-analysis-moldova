# Retail Sales Analysis – Republic of Moldova

This repository contains a retail sales analysis project based on a synthetic dataset representing customer purchases in the Republic of Moldova.

The project focuses on data preparation, aggregation, and visualization to identify patterns in customer behavior, sales distribution, and order volume.  
The analysis is implemented using Python and presented both as a Jupyter Notebook and an interactive Streamlit application.

## Project Scope

The analysis covers:
- Distribution of sales by gender and age group
- Order frequency and purchase amount analysis
- Regional and product-level aggregation
- Basic customer segmentation based on transactional data

The dataset is synthetic and created for educational and portfolio purposes.

## Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration  
- `Retail_Sales_Analysis_Moldova.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis  
- `products.csv` — product reference data  
- `README.md` — project documentation  

## Technologies Used
