# Retail Sales Analysis – Republic of Moldova

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of retail sales using Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
The analysis is based on a synthetic dataset generated specifically for the Republic of Moldova and is intended for educational and portfolio purposes.

## Key Objectives
- Explore customer purchasing behavior
- Analyze sales distribution by gender, age group, region, and product category
- Identify trends in order volume and total sales amount
- Demonstrate data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization skills

## Dataset
The dataset contains synthetic retail transaction data, including:
- Customer demographics (gender, age group, marital status)
- Geographic information (region and zone within Moldova)
- Product categories and order information
- Total purchase amounts

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis

## Notes
All data used in this project is synthetic and does not represent real individuals or real commercial transactions.
The project focuses on analytical techniques rather than real-world business conclusions.
